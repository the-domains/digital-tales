**Jason Brenizer **is the Managing Partner and the main force behind Digital Tales.

Once, he was a scientist. Not in a movie or a play, but once, long ago, he was a fully-fledged science-guy scientist. Then one day, while he was in the middle of carbon dating the Shroud of Turin -- or was it designing processors for Apple? -- like we said, it's been some time -- he decided to change directions and become an actor. Turns out, being strictly the science-guy just wasn't for him.

He cut his teeth on a string of low-budget projects before he found himself living in Europe in the mid 2000's, where he attended a film program in Prague.

He traveled half-way around the world to live in Singapore, where he started working professionally both in front and behind the camera. While there, he also acted in many short films by NYU Tisch Asia graduate students.

After nearly six years abroad, he was back in his hometown of Austin, Texas, where Digital Tales is physically based. With his success in audiobook narration and voiceover work, including video games such as DC Universe Online, Wizard101 and Pirate101 (where he plays over 70 characters), Jason has combined his technical, management, and artistic skills to create Digital Tales.

Just don't ask him to play a scientist. Well, maybe a mad scientist...
