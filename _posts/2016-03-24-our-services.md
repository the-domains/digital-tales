### Narration

We have relationships with a range of talented male and female narrators who perform both fiction and non-fiction. When possible, we like to record in our Austin, TX studio to capture clean, high quality signals and to free the actors from the technical work so they can focus on delivering their best, nuanced performances. But we are **Digital Tales**, and that means we can also hire the best performers from around the world who have their own high quality home recording capabilities.

### Editing

Editing is where a performance is shaped and fine tuned. Fiction often requires a keen ear for consistency of character. Non-fiction work calls for clarity and purpose of intent. An editor can play with tension and increase comprehension through pacing. Mistakes and omissions are also unearthed in this phase of production. It is our intent to render the author's work as accurately as possible and delight the listener.

### Mastering

Does the narrator take giant, audible breaths that might distract the listener? Does his mouth make strange clicks? Equalization, sibilance reduction, compression, signal boosting and smoothing - all these technical tasks are performed so the listener's imagination remains in the world presented by the author.

### Distribution & Marketing

We're here to help you decides how best to distribute your books and how to get the right readers and listeners to learn that they even exist.
