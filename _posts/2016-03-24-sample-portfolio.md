### Historical Crime Fiction

Digital Tales produced and Jason narrated **USA Today Bestselling author Kristine Kathryn Rusch's _The Enemy Within_**. The alternate reality crime novel called for many characters with accents from all over the USA. The publisher required that several character voices be historically accurate, most notably high profile 20th Century political figures Robert Kennedy (RFK) and Lyndon B. Johnson.

### Science Fiction & Fantasy

We've contracted to produce audiobooks for **Mike Lee's Vince Lombard series books 1 & 2: _StarFire _and _Fey_**. These hard edged, military science fiction action tales are delighting readers. If the reviews on Audible are any indication, listeners are loving the audio versions as well.

**Eli Constant's latest dystopian science fiction series begins with _DRAG.N_**. Ms. Constant's series takes a hard look at how endemic social and political issues of today might create larger problems in the future.
